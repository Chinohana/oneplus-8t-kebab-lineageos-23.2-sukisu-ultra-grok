# OnePlus 8T (kebab) LineageOS 23.2 + SukiSU-Ultra

This repository builds the official LineageOS 23.2 kernel for the OnePlus 8T (`kebab`) with SukiSU-Ultra entirely in GitHub Actions.

## Compatibility

- Device: OnePlus 8T (`kebab`)
- ROM base: LineageOS 23.2
- Kernel source: `LineageOS/android_kernel_oneplus_sm8250`, branch `lineage-23.2`
- Kernel: Linux 4.19
- SukiSU-Ultra: `v4.1.3` by default
- Integration: built-in, non-GKI
- KPM: enabled
- SUSFS: not included

SukiSU-Ultra officially supports manually built legacy kernels from Linux 4.4 onward. This project pins the latest stable release while keeping the SukiSU ref selectable from the workflow dispatch form.

Linux 4.19 does not provide `path_umount`, which current SukiSU-Ultra uses for per-app mount namespace cleanup. The workflow applies a small backport before compilation and records all resolved source commits in the artifact.

## Build with GitHub Actions

1. Open **Actions**.
2. Select **Build kebab kernel with SukiSU-Ultra**.
3. Choose **Run workflow**.
4. Keep the defaults for an official LineageOS 23.2 build, or provide explicit source refs.
5. Download the build artifact after the job succeeds.

Every artifact contains:

- `Image`: raw arm64 kernel image
- `kebab-lineage-23.2-sukisu-ultra-*.zip`: AnyKernel3 flashable package
- `build-info.txt`: resolved kernel and SukiSU-Ultra commit SHAs, compiler version, and kernel release
- `kernel.config`: final build configuration
- `SHA256SUMS`: checksums for the raw image and flashable ZIP

## Flashing warning

Unlocking the bootloader and flashing a custom kernel can erase data or make the device unbootable. Back up the current `boot` partition and keep a known-good LineageOS 23.2 boot image available. The ZIP is restricted to `kebab`, but you are responsible for matching it to your installed LineageOS build. Keep fastboot or recovery access available before relying on the kernel.

Install the SukiSU-Ultra manager matching this kernel after flashing. Download the GitHub Actions artifact, extract its outer ZIP, then flash the inner AnyKernel3 ZIP.

## Reproducibility

The workflow defaults to the official LineageOS branch, SukiSU-Ultra `v4.1.3`, and the LineageOS 23.2 Clang revision. The artifact records the exact kernel and SukiSU commits used by each build.
